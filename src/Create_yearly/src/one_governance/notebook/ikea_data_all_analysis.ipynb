      "Greetings to our esteemed Partners and Supporters,\n",
      "\n",
      "As we reflect upon the year gone by, it is with a sense of gratitude that we acknowledge the progress we've made and the challenges we've surmounted. The IKEA Foundation, established in 1982 by Ingvar Kamprad, continues its unwavering commitment to bettering everyday life for many, especially those grappling with the twin threats of poverty and climate change.\n",
      "\n",
      "This year, we embarked on a significant project titled \"Donation: Africa Private Sector Forum on Forced Displacement 2023,\" in concert with Inkomoko and Amahoro Coalition. The project, aimed at involving private sector participants in displacement settings, fostering partnerships, and driving investments toward displacement-focused initiatives, has proven instrumental in achieving a satisfaction rating of 8/10, thanks to the contributions of our partners and the project team led by Peter Mwangi.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, we are mindful that our task is far from complete. There are areas, such as organizational processes, that require further enhancement. We also contend with challenges such as the lack of awareness about displacement issues among private sector participants and political uncertainties in the region. Regardless, our resolve remains unshakeable. We are optimistic about the project's potential to reduce inequality, in line with UN Goal 10, and are committed to seeing it through to its conclusion in May 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we forge ahead, we remain grounded in our core values: togetherness, caring for people and planet, cost-consciousness, simplicity, renewing and improving, and leading by example. We are steadfast in our efforts to help families living in poverty, support displaced individuals, and take aggressive climate action to significantly curtail greenhouse gas emissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your unwavering support bolsters our ability to aim higher, such as our commitment to reduce global emissions by €1 billion between 2021 and 2025. We look forward to our continued journey together, transforming systems, building evidence of what works, and most importantly, making a meaningful difference in the lives of those we serve.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you for being part of our mission. Your belief in our work fuels our endeavors, and we are hopeful about the positive changes we can effect together. \n",

      "\n",
      "The IKEA Foundation is steadfast in its commitment to creating a better everyday life for the many people, enabling families to create a brighter future for themselves and their children while fighting and coping with climate change. Our mission is rooted in the vision of our founder, Ingvar Kamprad, who believed in creating opportunities for vulnerable families and children on a healthy planet [x]. \n",
      "\n",
      "Over the years, we have expanded our mandate to tackle poverty and climate change, the two biggest threats to the future of children living in some of the most vulnerable parts of the world. We see these threats as inextricably linked, as poverty is often underpinned by inequalities and exacerbated by the impacts of climate change [x]. \n",
      "\n",
      "As a strategic philanthropy, we focus our grant-making efforts on these challenges, working with more than 140 partners [x] to improve family incomes and protect the planet. We aim to transform systems and build evidence of what works, guided by our core values: togetherness, caring for people and planet, cost-consciousness, simplicity, renew and improve, being different with a meaning, giving and taking responsibility, and leading by example [x].\n",
      "\n",
      "Our mission is not only to provide funding but also to foster collaboration, cut through complexity, and take risks when necessary to achieve our goals. We believe in the power of long-term, ongoing support, and are committed to supporting programmes that help families afford a better everyday life and protect the planet, as well as programmes that help refugees and other displaced people become self-reliant in their new communities [x].\n",
      "\n",
      "We uphold a strong ethical framework, built on a solid foundation of honesty, openness, trust, and fairness [x]. In all our activities and the activities we fund, we do not tolerate misconduct and encourage all our stakeholders, including our partners and their employees, to raise any concerns they may have relating to misconduct.\n",
      "\n",
      "In line with our mission, we have pledged to reduce global emissions by €1 billion between 2021 and 2025 [x]. This commitment, coupled with our ongoing projects and partnerships, underscores our dedication to our mission and the positive change we aim to bring about in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through our work, we strive to live up to Ingvar's vision for the Foundation, helping families and children in vulnerable communities create sustainable livelihoods and ensure a healthy planet for future generations. Together, we can make a difference. Together, we can create a better everyday life for the many people. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. Executive Summary:\n",

Our mission to address poverty and climate change, the most significant threats to children's future, is reflected in our projects, partnerships, and financial commitments.\n",
      "\n",
      "This year, our projects and collaborations have had a global reach, with a particular emphasis on Africa and Asia. A prime example is our project \"Donation: Africa Private Sector Forum on Forced Displacement 2023\", demonstrating our commitment to engaging and mobilizing the private sector toward addressing displacement issues. We have committed 50% of the total project funding, amounting to $1,500,000 USD, and have partnered with influential organizations like Inkomoko and Amahoro Coalition. Despite challenges posed by political instability in the region and a lack of awareness among private sector actors, the project has shown promise, receiving an overall satisfaction ranking of 8/10.\n",
      "\n",
      "Financially, our commitment to our mission and values remains steadfast. Since our founding, we have granted €1.8 billion and are now granting approximately €200 million each year. Recognizing the urgency of climate action, in 2021, our board of directors decided to make an additional €1 billion available over the next five years to accelerate the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we look to the coming year, we plan to continue our current initiatives and launch new ones, maintaining our focus on sustainability, resilience, and inclusive growth. We are excited about the potential of our ongoing projects and are committed to exploring innovative solutions to the challenges we aim to address.\n",
