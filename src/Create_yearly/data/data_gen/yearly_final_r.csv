"Hey Friends and Supporters of IKEA Foundation,

What a ride 2023 has been, right? As I sit down to pen this annual shout-out, I'm filled with massive gratitude and amped up to charge into the future. This year hit us with its fair share of highs and some real tests that made us tougher and more determined.

Here’s the scoop on what we’ve been up to at the IKEA Foundation. Our main gig is making life a whole lot better for folks who’ve got it rough, especially when it comes to beating poverty and taking on climate change. 

**What We’ve Nailed This Year**

We kicked off some pretty rad projects. Take the African Private Sector Forum on Forced Displacement, which we launched in May 2023 over in Nairobi, Kenya. It’s all about getting jobs for people in refugee communities, and we’re talking a 30% bump in employment opportunities already! We threw down $500,000 for this, and we’re just getting started.

Then there’s The Funders Table. We rolled this out in April 2023 with a cool $5,000,000 to wage war on climate change. Our foundation chipped in 40% of that cash, and we’re on track to slash carbon emissions by 30% in the projects we’re backing.

And we can’t forget the Just Transition Fund—started the same time as the Funders Table. This one’s a global effort aiming to cut carbon emissions by 25% and boost renewable energy use by 40% in places like South Africa, Vietnam, and Indonesia. Sure, we’ve hit some snags, but we’re teaming up with big names worldwide to smooth out the bumps.

**The Bumps Along the Way**

No sugarcoating here—we’ve had our fair share of challenges. Political messes and logistical headaches have thrown some wrenches in our works. But hey, we’re learning as we go, tweaking our game plan to keep our projects on track.

**What’s Next on the Horizon**

Looking ahead, we’re not just sticking to the script—we’re looking to rewrite it. More projects, broader scope, and deeper impact. We’re all about leveling up and spreading the good even further.

**Big Ups**

Massive thanks to every partner, donor, and team member. You guys are the real MVPs. Your energy and support fuel our mission and make all this possible. 

Thanks for sticking with us and believing in what we do. Together, we’re crushing it and making real change.

Catch you later,
