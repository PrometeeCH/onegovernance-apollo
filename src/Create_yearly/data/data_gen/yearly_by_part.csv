1,"Title: Letter from the Chairperson/President

Greetings,

As we look back at a year filled with great challenges, I am pleased to report that the IKEA Foundation has made significant strides in advancing our mission. We have made meaningful progress in tackling poverty and climate change, the two most significant threats to the future of children living in vulnerable parts of the world [x].

We are proud to report that, in partnership with over 140 organizations [x] around the globe, we have effectively addressed numerous challenges and made substantial progress in improving family incomes and protecting our planet. This year, our work has focused on transforming systems and building evidence of what works.

Our commitment to creating a better everyday life for the many people has been unwavering. We have launched four critical projects: The EAT-Lancet 2.0, The Climate Story Fund, The Climate Resilience Roadmap, and the Economic Inclusion as a Pathway to Self-Reliance. These projects have been designed to address key global issues such as hunger, climate change, resilience, and economic growth in alignment with the United Nations' Goals [x].

Our project, EAT-Lancet 2.0, has been making strides towards achieving Zero Hunger, one of the United Nations' Goals [x]. We are grateful to our partners, especially the project management led by Sara Johansson, for their tireless efforts [x]. The Climate Story Fund and the Climate Resilience Roadmap are making significant contributions to fighting climate change, another crucial UN Goal [x]. Our fourth project, Economic Inclusion as a Pathway to Self-Reliance, is diligently working towards promoting decent work and economic growth in Kenya, Nairobi [x].

Though we have achieved much, there is still more to be done. We will continue to strive towards our goal of creating a better everyday life for the many people, while also preserving our planet for future generations [x].

We would like to extend our deepest gratitude to our partners, sponsors, and contributors for their unwavering support and commitment. Our achievements would not have been possible without your dedication and belief in our cause.

As we move forward, we remain committed to our core values of togetherness, caring for people and planet, cost-consciousness, simplicity, renewal and improvement, leading by example, and taking responsibility [x]. We are excited about the future and look forward to continuing our work with you.

On behalf of the IKEA Foundation, I would like to express our profound appreciation for your ongoing support. Together, let's create a better everyday life for the many people.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

The project has made good initial progress, and we are proud to be the sole sponsor of the project [x]. However, there is a need to diversify the funding sources for sustained project continuity [x].

3. Climate Resilience Roadmap: Focused mainly on Africa, this project aligns with the UN's Climate Action goal [x]. Our foundation contributed 30% of the total funding for this project, which has a total budget of €5.10M [x]. The project is making satisfactory progress, with visible improvements in local communities' resilience to climate changes [x].

3,"Title: Executive Summary

The IKEA Foundation has made substantial strides in 2023, working tirelessly towards our vision of creating a better everyday life for the many people. As a strategic philanthropy, we focus our efforts on tackling poverty and climate change, the two most significant threats to the future of children living in some of the most vulnerable parts of the world [x]. Our commitment to these causes has been demonstrated through various projects that we have funded and managed throughout the year [x].

Our financial overview reveals a total expenditure of €13.95M across four significant projects, with the IKEA Foundation contributing a total of €3.33M [x]. The projects, which align with the United Nations' Goals, have made substantial progress towards addressing global challenges, including Zero Hunger, Climate Action, and Decent Work and Economic Growth [x].

Despite the progress, we acknowledge that these projects face unique challenges, particularly related to funding stability, resource limitations, and political instability in some regions [x]. As we move forward, we are committed to addressing these issues to ensure project sustainability and maximum impact [x].

Our partnerships continue to be a crucial element in our work. Working with more than 140 partners, we have been able to improve family incomes and protect the planet [x]. However, we recognize the need to diversify our funding sources and involve more partners for increased funding and resources [x].

Our SWOT analysis highlights our strong partnerships and global reach as key strengths [x]. At the same time, we are aware of our weaknesses and threats, including high dependence on a single funding source and global economic instability [x]. We are optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead, particularly the potential to influence global policy on food security and climate change [x].

Reflecting on the past year, our satisfaction rankings across all projects averaged at 7.25/10 [x]. We take pride in these scores as they indicate overall satisfaction with our project progress and communication [x]. However, we are mindful of the areas that require improvement and are committed to enhancing our performance in the coming years [x].

Our future plans are ambitious but achievable. We aim to leverage our learnings from 2023 to strengthen our project execution, improve our communication strategies, and foster more robust partnerships [x]. With an additional €1 billion pledged to reduce global emissions between 2021 and 2025, we are well-positioned to accelerate our efforts in the fight against climate change [x].

In conclusion, the IKEA Foundation remains steadfast in our commitment to improving lives and protecting the planet. We would like to extend our heartfelt gratitude to our partners, sponsors, and everyone who has supported us in our mission. The journey ahead is challenging but promising, and together, we can make a significant difference [x].

9,"Title: Foundation Governance and Project Achievements

The IKEA Foundation has a solid governance structure that ensures the effective and efficient execution of our philanthropic work. Our governance is characterized by a board of directors that includes five members, each with a single vote.

Our ethical framework is the cornerstone of our operations. It is built on honesty, openness, trust, and fairness.

We remain committed to these principles and values as we continue to work towards creating a better everyday life for the many people [x].

In conclusion, the IKEA Foundation continues to make a meaningful impact in tackling poverty and climate change through our strategic philanthropy.

We understand the challenges that lie ahead. Global economic instability, political instabilities, and the ongoing impacts of climate change can pose risks to our projects [x]. However, we are prepared to address these challenges with our robust funding network, strong global reach, and our commitment to daring to take risks and leading by example [x].

In terms of partnerships, we aim to foster stronger collaborations with our current partners and seek new partnerships to diversify our funding sources [x]. We also plan to enhance our communication strategies to ensure transparency and effective collaboration among all stakeholders [x].

Finally, we plan to institutionalize the learnings from our projects to improve our processes and make more informed decisions [x]. We are also exploring opportunities to influence global policy on food security and climate change [x].
