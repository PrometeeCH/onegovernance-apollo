1,"Title: Letter from the Chairperson/President

Dear Stakeholders,

As we reflect on the year gone by, I am filled with immense gratitude and pride for the achievements that we, at the IKEA Foundation, have accomplished. This year, we have been able to make significant strides towards our vision of creating a better everyday life for the many people, especially those in vulnerable parts of the world, affected by poverty and climate change.

One of our major projects this year was the ""Donation: Africa Private Sector Forum on Forced Displacement 2023 [x]."" This project, which is aligned with UN Goal 10, was initiated in May 2023 [x] and is expected to conclude by May 2024. With a budget of $3,000,000 USD [x], we are proud to have contributed 50% of the total funding, amounting to $1,500,000 USD [x]. This project has seen the collaboration of influential organizations like IKEA Foundation, Inkomoko, and Amahoro Coalition [x]. It has also received an overall satisfaction ranking of 8/10 [x], indicating the positive impact it has had so far.

However, the year was not without its challenges. One of the main issues we faced was the lack of awareness among private sector actors about displacement issues. Despite this, we have been able to successfully engage 100+ private sector actors in displacement settings and facilitate 50+ partnerships between the private sector and NGOs. Our ultimate objective to generate $5m+ in investments for displacement-focused initiatives [x] is still very much in sight, and we are confident of achieving it.

The IKEA Foundation's work is built on our solid foundation of honesty, openness, trust, and fairness, as outlined in our Ethical Framework [x]. Our focus remains on helping families living in poverty and people who have been forced to flee their homes to build sustainable livelihoods. We are equally committed to bold climate action to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help vulnerable communities adapt to the impact of climate change [x].

Looking ahead, our aim is to continue to work with our 147 partners [x] across Africa and Asia in communities affected by climate change and poverty. We remain committed to our pledge of €1 billion to reduce global emissions between 2021 and 2025 [x], and we will continue to support global climate action programmes.

In conclusion, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to our partners, stakeholders, and everyone who has supported us in our journey. Your support has been vital in helping us make a significant impact in the lives of many people and contribute towards a better future. 

Together, we can continue to make a difference.

Yours sincerely,

[Your Name]
Chairperson/President, IKEA Foundation"
2,"Title: Mission Statement

The mission of the IKEA Foundation is to address the dual global crises of poverty and climate change. We are a strategic philanthropic organization that aims to create a better everyday life for the many people, particularly for children living in the most vulnerable parts of our world [x]. Our mission is guided by the vision of our founder, Ingvar Kamprad, who sought to create opportunities for vulnerable families and children to build a brighter future for themselves on a healthy planet [x].

Our work is underpinned by the belief in and commitment to the values of togetherness, care for people and planet, cost-consciousness, simplicity, the drive to renew and improve, being different with a meaning, giving and taking responsibility, and leading by example [x]. These values form the backbone of our initiatives and guide our interactions with our partners and beneficiaries.

We recognize the inequalities that underpin poverty and climate change and, therefore, we aim to transform systems and build evidence of what works. Our foundation has supported over 147 partners [x] with the goal to improve family incomes and protect the planet. Since our founding, we have granted more than €1.8 billion [x] to our partners and continue to grant approximately €200 million each year.

To accelerate the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, our board of directors has made an additional €1 billion available over the next five years [x]. Our work spans across Africa and Asia, in communities affected by climate change and poverty.

In our dedication to enabling families to create a better future and cope with climate change, we continue to engage in projects that align with our mission. One such endeavor is our project, ""Donation: Africa Private Sector Forum on Forced Displacement 2023 [x].""

This project, aimed at reducing inequality, encapsulates our mission to engage private sector actors in displacement settings and facilitate partnerships between the private sector and NGOs. Despite the challenges faced, including the lack of awareness among private sector actors on displacement issues, the project has made notable progress and received positive feedback from all parties involved [x].

Our mission is not just about what we do; it's about how we do it. We strive to lead by example, fostering relationships based on trust, cutting through complexity, sharing knowledge, collaborating transparently, daring to take risks, and living up to the standards that we promote [x].

As we move forward, we remain committed to our mission. We continue to strive for a better everyday life for the many people, and we remain dedicated to tackling poverty and climate change. Together, we can, and will, make a difference."

4,"Title: Year in Review/Highlights

The past year has been a significant one in the IKEA Foundation's ongoing journey to tackle poverty and climate change. Building on our vision to create a better everyday life for the many people, we have made strides in our mission to enable families to create a better future for themselves and their children, and fight and cope with climate change [x].

One of our most notable endeavours, the ""Donation: Africa Private Sector Forum on Forced Displacement 2023 [x],"" has made impressive progress. The project, which aligns with UN Goal 10 of reducing inequality, has successfully engaged over 100 private sector actors in displacement settings and facilitated more than 50 partnerships between the private sector and NGOs [x]. The ultimate objective of generating over $5 million in investments for displacement-focused initiatives underlines the impact of this initiative [x].

This project is a testament to the power of partnerships and the profound impact of the private sector's involvement in addressing displacement issues. Collaborating with influential organizations like Inkomoko, the Amahoro Coalition, and the African Entrepreneur Collective, we have mobilized a sizable portion of the project's $3 million budget [x]. The IKEA Foundation has contributed 50% of the total funding, amounting to $1.5 million [x]. 

The project's success is highlighted by an overall high satisfaction ranking of 8/10 from all parties involved [x]. The feedback underscores the project's strong potential and emphasizes the need for continued awareness and involvement from private sector entities.

Financially, our commitment remains strong. Since our founding, the IKEA Foundation has granted over €1.8 billion [x], and we continue to grant approximately €200 million each year. Additionally, our board of directors has shown their commitment to accelerating the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by pledging an additional €1 billion over the next five years [x].

Our partnerships remain a cornerstone of our work. With over 147 partners [x], we continue to collaborate with organizations across Africa and Asia, focusing on communities affected by climate change and poverty. 

In conclusion, the past year has been marked by significant progress towards achieving our mission. As we look forward to the next year, we remain dedicated to our vision and the important work ahead. Our focus remains steadfast: to create a better everyday life for the many people, particularly children living in the most vulnerable parts of the world."
5,"Title: Programs and Services Overview

The IKEA Foundation's commitment to creating a better everyday life for the many people is demonstrated through our diverse range of programs and services. These initiatives are designed to tackle two of the world's most pressing issues: poverty and climate change. Our programs focus on fostering sustainable livelihoods, championing renewable energy, empowering green entrepreneurship, supporting agricultural livelihoods, and aiding refugee livelihoods [x].

One prime example of our work is the ""Donation: Africa Private Sector Forum on Forced Displacement 2023 [x]."" This project embodies our commitment to poverty alleviation and climate action through its objective to involve the private sector in addressing displacement issues. The project has successfully engaged over 100 private sector actors in displacement settings and facilitated over 50 partnerships, aiming to generate over $5 million in investments for displacement-focused initiatives [x].

This initiative underscores our commitment to partnerships and highlights the profound impact of the private sector's involvement in addressing global challenges. In partnership with influential organizations like Inkomoko, the Amahoro Coalition, and the African Entrepreneur Collective, we have taken significant steps towards achieving the project's objective [x].

The project's success is evident in the positive feedback received, with an overall high satisfaction ranking of 8/10 from all parties involved [x]. However, there remains room for improvement, particularly in raising awareness and securing further involvement from private sector entities.

Our programs and services also extend to climate action, with the IKEA Foundation pledging an additional €1 billion over the next five years to accelerate the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions [x]. This commitment aligns with our thematic focus on the planet, underscoring our dedication to drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions and helping vulnerable communities adapt to the impacts of climate change [x].

Moreover, emergency response and special initiatives form another crucial aspect of our work. We are committed to responding to emergencies and helping displaced people rebuild their lives [x]. This commitment is reflected in our funding allocation each year for emergency relief, particularly for unseen emergencies that do not make global headlines but are increasing in frequency and impact due to climate change [x].

With over 147 partners [x], the IKEA Foundation continues to work across Africa and Asia, focusing on communities affected by climate change and poverty. As we look ahead, we remain dedicated to our mission and the critical work that lies before us, always striving towards our vision of creating a better everyday life for the many people."

8,"Title: Volunteer Contributions

The IKEA Foundation believes in the power of collective action and values the essential role of volunteers in our projects. Over the past year, our volunteers have made significant contributions to the ""Donation: Africa Private Sector Forum on Forced Displacement 2023 [x]"" project.

Volunteers played a pivotal role in raising awareness about the project. They engaged with private sector entities, facilitating understanding of displacement issues and the importance of their involvement. These efforts have been instrumental in engaging over 100 private sector actors in displacement settings and securing partnerships with over 50 NGOs [x].

In terms of hours contributed, our volunteers dedicated a significant amount of their time to ensure the successful execution of the project. While we do not have exact numbers, we know that the efforts of these selfless individuals have been crucial in the overall success of the project. It is thanks to their dedication, hard work, and commitment that we have been able to make such significant strides towards our goals.

We would like to highlight the efforts of our Project Manager, Peter Mwangi, who has been tireless in his efforts to manage and coordinate the project effectively. His leadership and direction were key to the project's success. In addition, the African Entrepreneur Collective served as the consultant for this project, providing invaluable expertise and guidance.

Volunteers' contributions also extended to the broader IKEA Foundation mission. The Foundation's commitment to reducing inequality, tackling poverty, and addressing climate change [x] was furthered by the contributions of volunteers. Their efforts have not only helped us progress towards our UN-aligned goals but have also embodied our values of togetherness, caring for people and planet, simplicity, renewal and improvement, and leading by example [x].

As we look forward to the next year, we are excited about the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead.

9,"Title: Governance and Organizational Structure

The IKEA Foundation operates on the principles of trust, transparency, and responsible decision-making, guided by a strong governance structure [x]. The Foundation's Board of Directors is our ultimate decision-making body, comprising five seats with each member having one vote. The board may delegate their authority to approve grants to internal committees within the IKEA Foundation, ensuring that grants can be approved in the most effective and responsible manner [x]. 

In line with our commitment to transparency, the IKEA Foundation has established an Ethical Framework that sets out our values and ethical standards. Misconduct of any form is not tolerated, and we encourage all our stakeholders to come forward with any concerns relating to misconduct [x]. 

Over the past year, the governance structure of the IKEA Foundation underwent no significant changes. The Foundation continues to be guided by its core values of togetherness, caring for people and planet, cost-consciousness, simplicity, renewing and improving, leading by example, and giving and taking responsibility [x].

The IKEA Foundation is also committed to creating the highest value with our resources, cutting through complexity in all our processes, institutionalising learning and knowledge sharing, engaging in transparent collaboration, and daring to take risks to create lasting impact [x]. This commitment is evident in our work on the ""Donation: Africa Private Sector Forum on Forced Displacement 2023 [x]"" project.

This includes projects that focus on renewable energy, employment and entrepreneurship, agricultural livelihoods, refugee livelihoods, emissions reduction, and climate action [x].

However, the IKEA Foundation is mindful of the challenges that lie ahead. The political instability in regions where we operate, such as Africa, can pose a threat to the progress of our projects [x]. To address this, we are committed to working closely with our partners on the ground to understand the local context and develop tailored strategies. We will also continue our efforts to increase awareness among private sector actors about displacement issues, which was identified as a weakness in our SWOT analysis [x].

In addition to these strategic goals, we will continue to uphold our commitment to our values and ethics. Our Ethical Framework and robust governance structure will guide our actions and decision-making, ensuring that we operate with integrity and transparency [x].

As we look to the future, the IKEA Foundation is committed to making a tangible difference in the lives of the many people. We will continue to strive for a better everyday life for all, demonstrating our commitment to caring for people and the planet [x].
