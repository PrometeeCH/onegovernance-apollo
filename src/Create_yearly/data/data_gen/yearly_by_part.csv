Dear Supporters and Partners,

As we look back on the year 2022, it is with a sense of pride and accomplishment that we reflect on the strides the IKEA Foundation has made towards our dual goals of improving livelihoods and ensuring environmental sustainability. This year, we have navigated the complexities of global challenges, amplifying our efforts to combat poverty and climate change, the two formidable adversaries against the prosperity of vulnerable communities across the globe.

The IKEA Foundation has been at the forefront of innovative projects that not only aim to uplift communities but also ensure that our planet remains a sustainable home for future generations. In collaboration with over 147 partners, we have managed to support impactful projects, directing substantial funds towards creating substantial change. This year alone, our commitment was demonstrated through the allocation of an additional €1 billion aimed at accelerating the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, a testament to our dedication towards bold climate action.

Our projects across Africa and Asia have shown promising progress in sustainable energy, regenerative agriculture, and livelihood enhancement. Notable among these is the “Scaling Standardized Climate and Sustainability Reporting” project, which aims to revolutionize sustainability reporting globally. Another significant endeavor, the “Powering Health” initiative in India, seeks to transform rural healthcare facilities through sustainable energy solutions.

However, our journey has not been without challenges. The varying pace of regulatory changes and the acceptance of sustainable practices in different regions have posed hurdles that we are continuously striving to overcome. Through it all, our resolve remains unshaken, bolstered by the unwavering support and dedication of our partners and supporters like you.

Looking ahead, the IKEA Foundation is excited to explore new avenues and expand our impact. We remain committed to our mission of empowering families to build a better future and fighting climate change.
