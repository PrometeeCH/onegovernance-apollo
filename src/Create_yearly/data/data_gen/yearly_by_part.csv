1,"**Letter from the Chairperson/President**

Dear Friends, Supporters, and Partners,

As we reflect on the past year, it is with a profound sense of gratitude and optimism that I address you through this letter. The IKEA Foundation has continued to make strides towards a world where children and families can lead prosperous lives on a healthy planet, guided by our mission to tackle poverty and climate change.

**Achievements of the Year**

This year, we've made significant progress in our key initiatives, most notably in our 'BeGreen Africa' [x] and 'Building digital communications for climate resilience' [x] projects. In Nairobi, under the ‘BeGreen Africa’ project, our efforts have been directed towards increasing renewable energy usage by 40% in local communities. This initiative not only aligns with the United Nations' Goal 13 for Climate Action but also enhances entrepreneurial skills among the youth, which is crucial for sustainable development.

Across Europe, North America, and South America, our 'Building digital communications for climate resilience' project aims to improve public awareness and engagement on climate issues. With a substantial completion of its funding [x], the initiative is set to enhance digital outreach by 40%, making a significant impact on climate action narratives.

**Challenges Encountered**

Despite our successes, we faced challenges, notably the limited technology infrastructure in Africa and the rapid technological changes in digital communications which could potentially alienate non-tech savvy stakeholders [x]. However, these challenges serve as catalysts for growth and innovation, pushing us to enhance our strategies and execution.

**Looking Forward**

As we look to the future, we are excited about the potential to scale these projects to other regions and to integrate more advanced technologies to increase their efficiency and impact. The foundation is committed to continuous improvement and adaptation to ensure that our projects not only meet their current goals but also set the pace for future initiatives.

**Gratitude and Call to Action**

We owe our progress to the relentless effort of our project leaders, the strategic guidance of our partners, and the invaluable support from donors and supporters like you. As we forge ahead, we invite you to continue this journey with us, to reach more communities, and to make an even greater impact in the lives of those we serve.

Together, we can build a sustainable future where both people and the planet thrive.

Thank you for your continued support.

Warm regards,

[Name]
Chairperson/President, IKEA Foundation"
