1,"Title: Letter from the Chairperson/President

Dear Friends of the IKEA Foundation,

This year has been one of progress and challenges, of dedication and determination. As we reflect on 2023, we are humbled by the strides we have made and the challenges we have overcome.

One of our central initiatives this past year was the Africa Private Sector Forum on Forced Displacement. This project, targeting Africa, aligns with the United Nations' Goal 16, promoting Peace and Justice Strong Institutions[x]. We are proud to report that we executed this project under the model of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)[x], with a total budget of $1,500,000[x].

We have contributed 60% to the total funds raised thus far [x], working alongside our partners Inkomoko and Amahoro Coalition[x]. Despite the challenges of political instability in the region[x] and limited engagement from the private sector[x], we have persevered and continue to work towards our target of engaging 500 private sector actors in displacement settings[x].

The IKEA Foundation, with over 140 partners[x], has been dedicated to improving family incomes and protecting the planet. Since our founding, we have granted over €1.8 billion[x], with a pledge to reduce global emissions between 2021 and 2025 by €1 billion[x]. We take pride in our commitment to helping families living in poverty and people who have been forced to flee their homes to build sustainable livelihoods[x].

Our values such as togetherness, caring for people and planet, cost-consciousness, simplicity, and renewal and improvement[x], guide us in our work. Our focus is on renewable energy, employment & entrepreneurship, agricultural livelihoods, and refugee livelihoods[x].

Looking ahead, we are invigorated and excited by the potential for positive change. As we continue our work in Africa and Asia, we are committed to tackling the inequalities that underpin poverty and climate change[x]. With the continued support of our partners, stakeholders, and supporters like you, we are confident that we will make significant strides towards creating a better everyday life for many people[x].

On behalf of the IKEA Foundation, I extend our deepest gratitude to all who have supported us this past year. Your dedication and commitment have been invaluable in our quest to improve lives and protect our planet. We look forward to sharing more of our work and achievements with you in the coming year.

Warm Regards,
