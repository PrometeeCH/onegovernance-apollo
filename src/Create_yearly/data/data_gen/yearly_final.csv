"**1. Letter from the Chairperson/President:**

Dear Supporters and Partners,

Reflecting on the year 2022, I am filled with a sense of pride and accomplishment as we review the significant strides the IKEA Foundation has made towards improving livelihoods and ensuring environmental sustainability. Despite global challenges, we have intensified our efforts to combat poverty and climate change, which pose significant threats to vulnerable communities worldwide.

The Foundation has spearheaded innovative projects aimed at uplifting communities and preserving our planet for future generations. Collaborating with over 147 partners, we directed substantial funds towards impactful projects, including an additional allocation of €1 billion to accelerate the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Our projects across Africa and Asia have made promising advances in sustainable energy, regenerative agriculture, and livelihood enhancement.

However, we faced challenges, including regulatory changes and the acceptance of sustainable practices in various regions. Despite these hurdles, our dedication remains strong, supported by the unwavering commitment of our partners and supporters like you.

Looking forward, we are excited to explore new avenues to expand our impact. We extend our deepest gratitude for your continued support and partnership, which have been instrumental in our achievements.

Warm regards,

[Your Name]
