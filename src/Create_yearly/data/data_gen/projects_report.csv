1. Project Overview:

The project, titled ""Donation: Africa Private Sector Forum on Forced Displacement 2023 [x],"" is spearheaded by IKEA Foundation. It is a part of their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative mainly focusing on the African continent. The city and country specifics are yet to be disclosed, though it is plausible that Nairobi, Kenya, might be the location of interest.

2. Project Timeline:

The project is set to commence in May 2023 [x] and is expected to conclude by May 2024. 

3. Budget and Funding:

The project entails a plausible budget of $3,000,000 USD [x], with the funding status currently open. IKEA Foundation has contributed 50% of the total funding, which is a plausible amount of $1,500,000 USD [x]. The remaining sum of $1,500,000 USD [x] is yet to be funded.

4. Partnerships and Contributions:

The project is a collaborative effort of IKEA Foundation (50%), Inkomoko (25%), and Amahoro Coalition (25%) [x]. Peter Mwangi has been appointed as the Project Manager with the African Entrepreneur Collective serving as the consultant for this project.

5. UN Goals and Objectives:

Aligned with UN Goal 10, this project aims to reduce inequality through the engagement of 100+ private sector actors in displacement settings and the facilitation of 50+ partnerships between the private sector and NGOs. The ultimate objective is to generate $5m+ in investments for displacement-focused initiatives.

6. SWOT Analysis:

The project's strength lies in its strong partnerships with influential organizations like IKEA and UNHCR. However, there is a lack of awareness among private sector actors on displacement issues, which serves as a weakness. The project has the opportunity to amplify the need to engage private sector actors in displacement settings. Nevertheless, the political instability in the region could pose as a threat to the progress of the project.

7. Satisfaction Rankings:

The project has received an overall satisfaction ranking of 8/10 from all parties, with the partners scoring a high 9/10. There is, however, room for improvement in organizational processes, which scored 7/10. Communication was also deemed satisfactory, scoring 8/10.

8. Comments and Feedback:

Comments stress on the project's strong potential, but underline the need for more awareness and involvement from private sector entities. The initiative has been appreciated for its aim to involve the private sector in addressing displacement issues.

9. Project Description:

The IKEA Foundation, in collaboration with the African Entrepreneur Collective, Amahoro Coalition, and UNHCR, is supporting the second African Private Sector Forum for Refugees. The partners aim to build on and amplify the need to engage private sector actors in displacement settings."
