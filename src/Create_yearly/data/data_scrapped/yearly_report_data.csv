The IKEA Foundation is a strategic philanthropy that focuses its grant making efforts on tackling poverty and climate change. We see these as the two biggest threats to the future of children living in some of the most vulnerable parts of the world.Together with more than 140 partners, we work to improve family incomes and protect the planet. Recognising the inequalities that underpin poverty on the one hand and climate change on the other hand, we aim to transform systems and build evidence of what works. Founded by Ingvar Kamprad in 1982, the IKEA Foundation initially focused on design and architecture. In 2009, we expanded our mandate that resulted in our current mission to enable families to create a better future for themselves and their children, and fight and cope with climate change.Since then, we have paid out more than €2 billion to our partners and now grant approximately €200 million each year. In 2021 our board of directors decided to make an additional €1 billion available over the next five years to accelerate the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.The IKEA Foundation works in some of the most vulnerable parts of the world where the needs are the greatest. We work with partners across Africa and Asia, in communities affected by climate change and poverty. We also support global climate action programmes, focusing on high-emitting countries and regions including the EU, India, Brazil and Indonesia, where we believe we can have the biggest impact.

What was Ingvar’s vision for the Foundation?Ingvar Kamprad’s vision for the IKEA Foundation was very clear. He wanted to create opportunities for vulnerable families and children to create a brighter future for themselves on a healthy planet.Ingvar grew up in a poor farming community in the south of Sweden. So, when he created IKEA in the 1940s, he wanted the retail business to provide a better life for the many people. You can find out more about Ingvar’s story here.In the same way, when Ingvar expanded the focus of the IKEA Foundation in 2009, he wanted to help children and families in vulnerable communities create sustainable livelihoods. This means being able to gain the right skills to become an entrepreneur like him or find a job that provides a decent family income.Ingvar also understood that the Earth has finite resources. If we want children in the future to live on a healthy planet, we need to take care of the environment now.

Our Ethical Framework
The work of the IKEA Foundation is built on a solid foundation of honesty, openness, trust and fairness. Our ethics are set out in detail in the IKEA Foundation Ethical Framework. 
We do not tolerate misconduct. We want all our stakeholders — including our partners and their employees — to feel encouraged and empowered to come forward and raise any concerns they may have relating to misconduct.
If you suspect any misconduct in our own activities or activities we fund, we ask you to please come forward, in good faith, to raise your concern. We will treat the matter in the strictest confidence and protect the identities of the people involved.
What is misconduct?
Misconduct is any unethical or unlawful behaviour, any criminal act, any violation of the IKEA Foundation Ethical Framework or a combination of these. For example, cases of corruption, bribery, harassment and fraud fall under this definition.
How can I raise a concern about misconduct?
The IKEA Foundation has set up a Trust Line to enable people to report any concerns about misconduct related to our work or the activities we fund. Our main priority is to identify and appropriately address any serious issue.
This Trust Line is powered by the SpeakUp® system, an integrated phone/web tool to report misconduct. Our Trust Line allows for 24/7 confidential reporting and meets all data protection regulations.
We will not tolerate negative effects or repercussions when you raise a concern in good faith, and you will not be put at a disadvantage.

Report a concern to the Trust Line"

We get the best results by working with partners who know the most about the areas we want to support. We support programmes managed by knowledgeable, innovative and well-regarded organisations that are experts in their fields.
Applying for funding
We do not accept unsolicited proposals.
Our principles
Our grant making is guided by our operating principles:

We create relationships based on trust.
We create the highest value possible with our resources.
We cut through complexity in all our processes.
We institutionalise learning and knowledge sharing.
We engage in transparent collaboration.
We dare to take risks and sometimes be the rebel in the sector.
We aim to live up to the standards that we are promoting.





Long-term, ongoing support
We support a wide range of programmes that help families afford a better everyday life and protect the planet, as well as programmes that help refugees and other displaced people become self-reliant in their new communities.
We also support pilot projects that can both make an impact now and be a good model for future programmes.
All programmes are designed to help people help themselves to a better life. They have a definite time limit and are often designed in close co-operation with local and national governments to ensure sustainability.

Grants for emergency relief
While we focus on trying to solve the problem before there is a disaster, we also allocate some funding each year to respond to emergency situations. Our primary focus is on unseen emergencies – those that do not make the headlines of the global news media.
These emergencies, while just as horrifying as the ones you see in the news are increasing in frequency and impact due to climate change. Yet they receive less funding than well-publicised disasters. They tend to happen outside Europe and North America, in communities that are already vulnerable. To support those people and communities impacted, we provide a set amount of unrestricted funding to our partners like Médecins Sans Frontières and local NGOs through the Start Fund so that they can act quickly to respond where they are most needed.
We use our platform to shine a light on unseen disasters when we believe it will help to bring other funders on board.




Grant making process
The IKEA Foundation Board of Directors is our ultimate decision-making body. The board has five seats and each board member has one vote. The board may delegate their authority to approve grants to internal committees within the IKEA Foundation with rigorous reporting requirements to ensure that grants can be approved in the most effective and responsible manner. 
Concept notes and proposals are developed by the partners in close consultation with the Foundation’s grant making team. The Board or delegated decision-making bodies decide whether the proposed programmes are within the Foundation’s charter and in line with our expectations for financial and operational efficiency, impact, as well as reflecting our core values.
A positive decision will require development of a detailed programme proposal, focused on creating a baseline, setting programme objectives and establishing key performance indicators that will be used to measure annual progress and ultimate programme achievement. Our partners have to demonstrate that funds have been used properly and according to original intentions, and our Board is involved in reviewing the results of the grant.
