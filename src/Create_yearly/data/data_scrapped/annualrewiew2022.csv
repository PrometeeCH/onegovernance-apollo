INTRODUCTION
boundaries, from our biosphere and oceans to land use and
climate, are being stretched like never before. The impact
of this is already being felt. In 2022, flooding left a third of
Pakistan under water. In East Africa, millions continued to be
affected by drought. In Europe, heatwaves caused thousands
of deaths.
Disasters like these show how closely poverty and the
climate crisis are linked. They destroy homes and livelihoods,
underlining the importance of limiting global warming to
1.5⁰C and dramatically reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
The IKEA Foundation is proud to be at the forefront of
philanthropy’s efforts to reduce emissions in this decisive
decade for our planet. A failure to act now will impact all
of us, particularly the most vulnerable communities in the
world.
2023 marks the halfway point in the implementation of
the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement and the UN Sustainable
Development Goals. The world is currently far behind where
it needs to be if we’re to meet these essential targets by
2030. In coming years, we must dramatically accelerate our
progress towards them.
The facts are clear, solutions exist, and resources can be
made available. All that remains is the will. If we decide to
act together, we at the IKEA Foundation are confident that a
brighter future is possible.This work has never
been more urgent
At the IKEA Foundation, we want to help create a brighter
future for children and their families living in some of the
most vulnerable communities. It’s a bold ambition, in a world
where poverty and climate change are making the future
seem less secure than ever.
We know that tackling these threats will require
unprecedented international collaboration and deep
changes to global systems. We also know that we can’t do
this on our own.
That’s why in 2022 we were grateful to work with 147
partners around the world, providing them with over €268
million in grants to create sustainable livelihoods and
address the climate crisis.
We continued to develop and share evidence of models that
work, helping our partners to achieve greater scale and
impact. Only by learning from what works can we make real
progress collectively.
This work has never been more urgent. Our planetary Per Heggenes

3,"THE IKEA FOUNDATION’S ANNUAL REVIEW 20224The IKEA Foundation is a strategic philanthropy that focuses
its grant making efforts on tackling the two biggest threats
to children’s futures: poverty and climate change. Together
with more than 140 partners, we work to improve family
incomes and quality of life while protecting the planet.
Recognising the inequalities that underpin poverty and
climate change, we aim to transform unfair systems and
support those affected. By building and sharing evidence
of what works, the IKEA Foundation aims to help drive the
positive change that is required.
Founded by Ingvar Kamprad in 1982 to support design
and architecture, the Foundation received its extended
mandate in 2009 to enable families to create a better future
for themselves and their children, and fight and cope with
climate change. Since then, the IKEA Foundation has paid
out more than €1.8 billion to its partners. In 2021, the board
of the IKEA Foundation decided to make an additional
€1 billion available over the subsequent five years – on top of
its annual grant making budget – to accelerate the reduction
of greenhouse gas emissions.Our vision
... is to create a better everyday life for
the many people. Families need both
a sustainable livelihood and a healthy
environment to build a better future for
themselves and their children. That’s
why our commitments to help families
improve their incomes and to protect the
planet go hand in hand.
Our mission
... is to improve the lives of vulnerable
children by enabling their families to
create sustainable livelihoods, and fight
and cope with climate change.
Our values
... are at the heart of everything we do.
• Togetherness
• Caring for people and planet
• Cost-consciousness
• Simplicity
• Renew and improve
• Different with a meaning
• Give and take responsibility
• Lead by exampleWe build long-term partnerships
to benefit the many people and
protect our planet.

5,"THE IKEA FOUNDATION’S ANNUAL REVIEW 2022Throughout 2022, our partners helped people living in some
of the most vulnerable communities around the world to
build sustainable livelihoods. To do this, they developed
new pathways and models providing important insights and
learnings in our areas of focus. For example, we supported
partners like PRADAN , icipe  and Kilimo Trust  to help
farming families regenerate the natural resources they
depend on and shift to planet-positive agriculture.
Our partners including CLASP , SELCO Foundation ,
Collectives for Integrated Livelihood Initiatives  and
Carbon Trust  brought solar-powered technologies to
communities in Africa and Asia. Thanks to their efforts,
access to renewable energy is becoming easier and
supporting families to enjoy a better life.
We joined forces with TechnoServe Inc.  and BOMA  to
prove that green entrepreneurship is a viable way to create
sustainable livelihoods. And we started working with WASTE
and VSO Nederland  to improve the livelihoods of waste
pickers in India and Kenya, together with city authorities and
large private sector waste recyclers.There’s also increasing evidence that the types of
interventions we’re funding – like the programme by UNHCR ,
the UN Refugee Agency  in Dollo Ado, Ethiopia – are helping
to build self-reliance among refugees and host communities.
And people who’ve experienced forced displacement had
an opportunity to raise their voices in a first-of-its-kind
publication by the University of Oxford Refugee-Led
Research Hub  in Nairobi.

models in the textile and food
sectors can create jobs, save

launched eight evaluations, in cooperation with our partners,
to better understand their impact in the communities they
work in.
Our partner, GiveDirectly , commissioned an evaluation
of an intervention to provide displaced people living in
the Kiryandongo refugee settlement in Uganda with an
unconditional cash transfer of $1,000. A 19-month evaluation,
which concluded in 2022, showed that families receiving

8At UN Climate Week in September, our partner The Museum
for the United Nations – UN Live , launched its “Global We”
initiative. The programme invited people from all walks of life into
conversations with one another through digital portals located
around the world. Here, more than 4,000 people have already
shared experiences and solutions to help unlock some of the most
complex challenges around climate change.
Many of our partners, including the Global Alliance for the
Future of Food , are leading the way in developing untapped
opportunities to combine food systems change and climate action.
We joined partners at the AGRF – Africa’s Foods Systems Forum
Summit , to discuss how regenerative agriculture can combat
climate change and provide sustainable livelihoods.  We also
supported Regen10  to explore how more of the world’s food can
be produced in a way that delivers positive outcomes for people,

was a landmark decision to help developing countries
respond to the effects of climate change.
Several of our partners played roles in this achievement.
The International Climate Politics Hub  helped keep
negotiations on track, while the  Climate Emergency
Collaboration Group  strengthened expert and institutional
capacity for the fund. The  Africa Climate Foundation ,
the Climate Justice Resilience Fund , and awardees of
the Climate Breakthrough  project also played key roles in
securing agreement on the fund. Their work demonstrated
the impact philanthropy can have in encouraging ambitious
climate action.
This research, conducted by Systemiq and RMI, is informing
how the IKEA Foundation deploys much of our 2021 pledge
to invest an additional €1 billion in emissions reduction
initiatives over 5 years. We hope its publication will inspire
other philanthropies to join us in funding climate action
urgently.

Our largest partner in this mission is
the Global Energy Alliance for People
and Planet  (GEAPP), which is accelerating
investment in green energy transitions and
renewable power around the world. 2022
was GEAPP’s first full year of operation.Last year, we announced two further grants
to partners working to reduce emissions.
These included $25 million in funding to
the Clean Cooling Collaborative  to support
its work encouraging the development
of efficient, climate-friendly cooling
technologies. The program targets regions
projected to be responsible for 75% of all
cooling-related emissions over the next 30
years: India, China, Southeast Asia, and the
United States.
We also provided a $20 million grant to
the Global Methane Hub , which is working
to cut international methane emissions
by 30% by 2030. At least 25% of today’s
warming is driven by methane from human
actions, with the oil and gas industry,
livestock and landfills being the heaviest
emitters. Reducing methane emissions is
the single most effective way
to rapidly slow the rise in global
temperatures.SUPPORTING OUR PARTNERS TO MAKE AN IMPACT

THE IKEA FOUNDATION’S ANNUAL REVIEW 2022
Our partnership with the IKEA Foundation began in 2016 with
a shared mission to invest in innovative solutions to improve
the livelihoods and resilience of low-income communities in
the world’s riskiest markets, supporting their green pathway
out of poverty.
And our partnership works because we believe in the same
grounding principles: trust, mutual learning and exchange,
and a human-centred approach to taking on the world’s
toughest challenges – from energy access to resilient
agriculture and refugee livelihoods.
They have also provided invaluable technical assistance to
resilient agricultural businesses serving more than 700,000
smallholder farmers and enhancing the livelihoods of around
3.5 million people.
Building on that success, in 2022, the IKEA Foundation’s
support helped Acumen launch a new $25 million initiative
to invest in renewable energy solutions that increase the
incomes and climate resilience of smallholder farmers
and micro-entrepreneurs. The Foundation also funded an
accelerator programme for ventures serving displaced people
in East Africa that trained 14 businesses to improve their
investment readiness and increase their impact.

12,"THE IKEA FOUNDATION’S ANNUAL REVIEW 202213With the help of the IKEA Foundation,
WMBC has been working since 2014 with
the world’s most influential businesses to
take action on climate change. Collectively
we’re pushing to halve global emissions
by 2030, an essential milestone in keeping
temperature rise to 1.5⁰C.
Recognising that this work is not easy, in
2022 we provided new direct guidance
to companies, making it as accessible
and simple as possible to enable them to
become climate leaders.Over 10,000 companies are now committed
to climate leadership thanks to initiatives
such as the Science Based Targets initiative,
of which WMBC was one of the founding
partners, and the SME Climate Hub which
we founded and host.
This progress helps drive greater ambition
from policymakers. The business support
we have mobilised helped secure some
big policy wins in 2022 such as the
Inflation Reduction Act in the US and the
Fitfor55 package in the EU, which will help
companies cut emissions even faster.
We need to move from thousands of
companies taking climate action to millions.
Thanks to IKEA Foundation leadership, we
have set the foundations for that growth.REFLECTIONS FROM OUR COMMUNITY
THE IKEA FOUNDATION’S ANNUAL REVIEW 2022 13
The IKEA Foundation has been an anchor
partner of GEAPP since its launch at COP26
in Glasgow in 2021.
GEAPP’s mission is to address the deep
inequities of energy poverty by bringing
clean energy to developing countries in
need of reliable power. Ending energy
poverty and decarbonisation are two sides
of the same coin – success hinges upon
each being accomplished simultaneously.
GEAPP was formed on a recognition that to
combat climate change a new approach and
spirit of cooperation is required. We partner
with multiple and diverse players united
by shared values – governments, private investors, innovators, philanthropists, and
more – coming together at pace to work in
radical and unprecedented ways.
2022 highlights included: unlocking
new finance flows for the energy sector
by supporting Just Energy Transition
programmes in South Africa and Indonesia;
enabling productive uses of clean energy
with Africa’s first solar powered large scale
irrigation system in Ethiopia; and driving
down the cost of renewable energy in
countries such as Nigeria, which has seen
a 25% cost reduction in technologies for
developers.
Alongside the IKEA Foundation, GEAPP is
helping to end energy poverty, spark global
development and fight climate change.
Together, we can change energy for good.

THE IKEA FOUNDATION’S ANNUAL REVIEW 2022 14The IKEA Foundation has enabled us to do
award-winning research on the economic
lives of refugees across East Africa - and to
share it with policymakers and practitioners
in ways that make a difference. The IKEA Foundation has been supporting
SELCO to bring renewable energy to
underserved communities around India
since 2017. In recent years much of our
work has focused on the healthcare sector,
particularly in response to the COVID-19
pandemic. In 2021, the IKEA Foundation
helped us provide 100 public health centres
in North-East India with efficient solar
energy solutions.
The success of this programme inspired
other funders and state governments
to support the programme as well.
By the end of 2022, it had reached more
than 1,700 health care facilities and
strengthened health care access for over 9
million people.We’ve been able to publish that
research and present it to UN agencies,
governments, and NGOs to inform their
self-reliance and livelihood policies.
We’ve also been able to make the research
participatory, including refugees in research
design and data collection, and supporting
people with lived experience to develop
research careers through our new Refugee-
Led Research Hub in Nairobi. The Hub has
produced original insights on themes such
as refugee-led organisations and refugees’
access to work permits, while supporting
many refugees to access graduate degrees
in Oxford and elsewhere.Both foundations believe that energy and
health infrastructure should not be planned
in silos. We are fortunate that India is
seeing sustainability and energy as core
components of healthcare delivery itself.
Energy has a critical role in empowering the
staff with the right equipment, improving
their sense of wellbeing, and improving
the service experience of the millions who
depend on public health. In leading this
effort, India is showcasing the processes
and systems that can be replicated in other
developing country contexts to accelerate
our achievement of the UN Sustainable
Development Goals.

I grew up in Lebanon during the civil
war and was internally displaced by the
conflict during my childhood. I became an
IKEA Foundation Ambassador because I
wanted to use my skills and experiences to
contribute to the Foundation’s mission and
be a spokesperson for the Foundation to my
IKEA co-workers.
By sharing the work of the Foundation with
my co-workers and the IKEA community,
I can bring a bit of hope to those around
me. I can show them how the Foundation
and their partners are creating sustainable
livelihoods and tackling climate change. When Ingvar Kamprad created the IKEA Foundation, he was
clear that he wanted the IKEA community to know about the
foundation and be proud of our efforts to create a better
everyday life for the many people.
To help fulfil this mission today, the IKEA Foundation visits
IKEA stores around the world to share our partners’ stories
and the extraordinary impact we’re achieving together.
We also engage a group of IKEA workers every year to
act as IKEA Foundation Ambassadors. This group has the
opportunity to meet some of our partners in person and
learn first-hand about their important work.
During 2022, we trained more
than 100 ambassadors so they
were ready to communicate
about the work of the IKEA
